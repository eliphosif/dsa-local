Sharanya Srinivasaâ€“ MTS3 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

first hour from Sharanya Srinivasa in a conference room 3rd floor

The interviewer began by asking a few technical questions about the database I use and my experience with it. Then, she moved on to two DSA questions. I managed to solve the first one, but I got stuck on the second, which was a string problem. She noticed my struggle and kindly told me it was okay to leave the question.
